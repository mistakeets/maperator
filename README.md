# maperator
A program that can generate terrain maps (or tiles for game map development purposes) using ASCII / unicode characters.

The concept behind this project is based on the Diamond coding exercise found on [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/exercises/javascript/diamond/readme). Inspiration also found within a blog post by written by [Seb Rose](http://claysnow.co.uk/recycling-tests-in-tdd/)
